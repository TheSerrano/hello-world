# hello-world

True, this is another hello-world rep BUT also created for my first commit in GitHub

Diego here, I like C# and Java. I want to try out Python to use it for machine learning stuff. I also want to experiment with cross platform app development because building apps with nice interfaces rocks (it rocks BIG TIME). Cheers everyone!
